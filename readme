The CS-470 course built off of the work achieved in CS-465. In CS-465, we built a website
using a MEAN stack. In this course, we learned about different ways to host that system. In the
first part of this course, we learned about containerization and setting up networks in Docker. In
the other section of this course, we covered cloud hosting solutions offered by AWS. We focused
in-depth on S3 storage, Lambda, Dynamo DB, and API Gateway development.
This course has increased my knowledge about different ways to launch web applications. This
knowledge can help me in roles which involve web development, cloud services,,
containerization, or even roles which require skills with AWS.
